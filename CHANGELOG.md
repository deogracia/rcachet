# rcachet Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

rcachet is in a pre-1.0 state. This means that its APIs and behavior are subject to breaking changes without deprecation notices. Until 1.0, version numbers will follow a [Semver][]-ish `0.y.z` format, where `y` is incremented when new features or breaking changes are introduced, and `z` is incremented for lesser changes or bug fixes.

## [Unreleased][]

* Your contribution here!
* Add support for the "general" Cachet API
